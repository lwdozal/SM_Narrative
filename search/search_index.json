Social movements have been using social media to share their goals, values, and grievances with the world for the past decade which spreads throughout platforms usually in visual form.This messaging is sprinkled in with other news and cultural events that fail to provide a full narrative of what is actually happening. I analyze the visual and textual narrative representations of the anti-feminicide movement in Mexico online using narrative structure, network science, visual analysis, and a combination of multi-modal computer vision / natural language processing models. The project considers various aspects of the research question including: data mapping by social movement practitioners; the network of different narrative frames based on semantic qualities and distinct features in social media posts; and biases provided by affordances (including algorithmic) of Instagram. The goal of this open science AI project is to find a more clear way to understand fragmented news on social media platforms by evaluating relationships between posts.</p> <p>Download the dissertation prospectus</p>"},{"location":"Data_Management_Plan/","title":"Data Management Plan","text":"<p>This document takes into consideration data collected and made available for researchers and practitioners.</p>"},{"location":"Data_Management_Plan/#1-data-description","title":"1. Data Description","text":"<p>The data is collected by web Application Program Interface (API) scrapers that target social media images of the anti-gender-violence movement in Mexico using relevant keywords and time frames. A customized content-scraper script was developed using python libraries and the Instaloader package which enables image and metadata collection of the Instagram social media platform. The scrapper opens the Instagram application under the project\u2019s account @LWDDissertation, and searches for a particular hashtag and instagram account. The hashtags and accounts include #mexicofeminicida, #m\u00e9xicofeminicida, #niunamenos, #vivasnosqueremos, #noestamostodas. The accounts include @noestamostodas, @siwapazyjusticia, @womansonfire, @brujamixteca. </p> <p>The current data consists of international posts mainly from Mexico, but also includes other countries in North and South America like Chile, Argentina, Brazil and the United States.

This information is spread throughout platforms usually in visual form, and from various perspectives. This information can be seen as fragmented and not fully informative. To solve this problem, this research uses mixed methods applications to understand narrative frames of online image content representing the anti-femicide movement in Mexico. This social movement is highlighted due to consistent social media messaging throughout the past decade with a recent increase in activity. This information also represents multiple perspectives from across the country. The methods used will work in tangent to first use deep learning models to classify narrative frames based on themes from academic literature, non-governmental organizations, and government. These frames are visualized in network form for experts in the anti-femicide movement. These experts will form a focus group to implement Gillian Rose\u2019s visual interpretation modalities to create an ontology of image relations. The ontology will be used in a knowledge graph which links dynamic data. This research offers theoretical contributions to computer vision, online social movement frames and images. It holds practical implications for computational social scientists using artificial intelligence to understand social phenomena.
