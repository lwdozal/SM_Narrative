# Data Management Plan

This document takes into consideration data collected and made available for researchers and practitioners.

## 1. Data Description
The data is collected by web Application Program Interface (API) scrapers that target social media images of the anti-gender-violence movement in Mexico using relevant keywords and time frames. A customized content-scraper script was developed using python libraries and the Instaloader package which enables image and metadata collection of the Instagram social media platform. The scrapper opens the Instagram application under the project’s account @LWDDissertation, and searches for a particular hashtag and instagram account. The hashtags and accounts include #mexicofeminicida, #méxicofeminicida, #niunamenos, #vivasnosqueremos, #noestamostodas. The accounts include @noestamostodas, @siwapazyjusticia, @womansonfire, @brujamixteca. 

The current data consists of international posts mainly from Mexico, but also includes other countries in North and South America like Chile, Argentina, Brazil and the United States. The languages are Spanish, English and Portuguese. Although the topic particularly targets Mexico, other countries were found in the top search results.

## 2. Data Collection
Metadata collected from the hashtags and accounts include comments, likes, hashtags, URLs, account information, and automated descriptions from Instagram’s API. So far, about 2,000 images have been collected within a year's timeframe between November 25, 2021, and November 25, 2023. The date November 25th was chosen because it is the international anti violence against women day, Dia Internacional contra la violencia hacia las mujeres. A second round of data collection will be done to include posts surrounding the topic on international women’s day. The goal is to download over 5,000 images and their metadata. 

## 3. Data Storage and Backup
The research findings and pubic facing data storage facilities will be de-identified for the privacy and safety of the participants. De-identification includes the removal of names and demographic information. Only organization names or description of organizations will be used in public facing research findings.


## 4. Data Organization and Documentation
In Github and ReData, the data will be de-identified and have an accompanying metadata file detailing data structure, variable definitions, and data processing steps. 


## 5. Data Preservation and Long-Term Access
This collected data will be saved in a private repository as well as in University of Arizona’s Research Data Repository, ReData. As this data will be considered my testing data in the machine learning models similar social movement data found on social media will be used as the training data. I hope to keep this data in an open repository to provide more diverse collection of social movement data for other research to learn from. 

## 6. Data Sharing and Access
The participants will be provided with links and access to the data to be used in their own research. The focus group data will not be kept for future research. Data collected beforehand and after the focus group will be saved. This collected data will be saved in a private repository as well as in University of Arizona’s Research Data Repository, ReData.

## 7. Data Ethics and Legal Compliance
Ethics approval is in process with the University of Arizona IRB board. All data collection follows ethical guidelines based on FAIR and CARE principals.


This Data Management Plan ensures responsible collection, storage, and sharing of the Anti-Femicide Movement Data. It promotes the transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility of social movement research.
