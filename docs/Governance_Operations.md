## Introduction

This Project Governance document defines operating procedures and rules aimed to clarify and support the involvement of a social movement dissertation for the iSchool and the FOSS reference hub.


#### Social Movement Narrative Dissertation

**Abstract**
Social movements have been using social media to share their goals, values, and grievances with the world for the past decade. This information is spread throughout platforms usually in visual form, and from various perspectives. This information can be seen as fragmented and not fully informative. To solve this problem, this research uses mixed methods applications to understand narrative frames of online image content representing the anti-femicide movement in Mexico. This social movement is highlighted due to consistent social media messaging throughout the past decade with a recent increase in activity. This information also represents multiple perspectives from across the country. The methods used will work in tangent to first use deep learning models to classify narrative frames based on themes from academic literature, non-governmental organizations, and government. These frames are visualized in network form for experts in the anti-femicide movement. These experts will form a focus group to implement Gillian Rose’s visual interpretation modalities to create an ontology of image relations. The ontology will be used in a knowledge graph which links dynamic data. This research offers theoretical contributions to computer vision, online social movement frames and images. It holds practical implications for computational social scientists using artificial intelligence to understand social phenomena.


#### FOSS Reference Hub

The FOSS reference hub is a reference repository for the [Foundational Open Science Skills (FOSS)](https://foss.cyverse.org/) workshop series. The aim of this repository is to serve as a reference for the [capstone](https://foss.cyverse.org/final_project/overview/), which FOSS attendees are expected to complete within the duration of the FOSS workshop.

The researcher, Laura Dozal, was selected as an R4R fellow to follow and implement FOSS practices for others in the field. 

The goals of the FOSS Reference Hub are to:
- Serve as a reference for a structured research object.
- Guide interested researchers through examples on how to enhance their project repositories.

### Dissertation Committee
- Chair: Dr. Jamie, Lee, Associate Dean, Faculty Affairs Associate Professor
- Dr. Zack Lischer-Katz, Assistant Professor Director of Graduate Studies
- Dr. Clayton Morrison, Associate Professor

### Procedures

All of the code base required for FOSS, the FOSS Reference Hub and the dplPy project is stored in their respective GitHub repositories:

- [FOSS](https://github.com/CyVerse-learning-materials/foss)
- [FOSS Reference Hub](https://github.com/CosiMichele/foss-reference-hub)
- Highlighted Example: [dplPy](https://github.com/OpenDendro/dplPy) 

All of these repositories can only be modified by the CyVerse/Data Science Institute team (or the dplPy team regarding the dplPy repository) or through a reviewed [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). Websites for FOSS ([foss.cyverse.org](https://foss.cyverse.org/)) and OpenDendro ([opendendro.org](https://opendendro.org/)) are created using [MkDocs-Material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), built through automated [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Community Practices

### Open Science Commitment 

We are committed to Open Science as we operate through transparency, collaboration, and accessibility, guided by the[FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable)](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618) and [CARE (Collective Benefit, Accountability, Responsibility, Equity)](https://www.gida-global.org/care) principles.

Our educational materials and publications are thoughtfully curated to align with Open Science ideals. We seek to empower others to adopt and implement Open Science practices, making research more accessible and reproducible.

### Land Acknowledgement

As part of the University of Arizona, we acknowledge and respect the land and territories on which we are able to perform our duties as educators with the following statement: *We respectfully acknowledge the University of Arizona is on the land and territories of Indigenous peoples. Today, Arizona is home to 22 federally recognized tribes, with Tucson being home to the O’odham and the Yaqui. Committed to diversity and inclusion, the University strives to build sustainable relationships with sovereign Native Nations and Indigenous communities through education offerings, partnerships, and community service.*

### Diversity Statement

We encourage everyone to participate and are committed to building a community for all. 
Although we will fail attimes, we seek to treat everyone as fairly and equally as possible. Whenever a participant has made a mistake, we expect them to take responsibility for it. If someone has been harmed or offended, if you are a witness to an event of this nature, it is your responsibility to both listen carefully and respectfully to the victims, as well as to take action to bring attention to the behaviour, and to make every effort to stop the behaviour. 

It is also our responsibility to do our best to right the wrong. 
Although this list cannot be exhaustive, we explicitly honor diversity in age, gender, gender identity or expression, culture, ethnicity, language, national origin, political beliefs, profession, race, religion, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and technical ability. We will not tolerate discrimination based on any of the protected characteristics above, including participants with disabilities.

### Code of Conduct

In conjunction with for using CyVerse cyberinfrastructure, this Code of Conduct applies to all Event participants and their activities while using CyVerse resources and/or attending the Event.

CyVerse is dedicated to providing professional computational research and educational experiences for all of our users, regardless of domain focus, academic status, educational level, gender/gender identity/expression, age, sexual orientation, mental or physical ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), technology choices, dietary preferences, or any other personal characteristic.

When using CyVerse or participating at an Event, we expect you to:

Interact with others and use CyVerse professionally and ethically by complying with our Policies.
Constructively critize ideas and processes, not people.
Follow the Golden Rule (treat others as you want to be treated) when interacting online or in-person with collaborators, trainers, and support staff.
Comply with this Code in spirit as much as the letter, as it is neither exhaustive nor complete in identifying any and all possible unacceptable conduct.
We do not tolerate harassment of other users or staff in any form (including, but not limited to, violent threats or language, derogatory language or jokes, doxing, insults, advocating for or encouraging any of these behaviors). Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate at any time (excludes Protected Health Information in compliance with HIPAA). Any user violating this Code may be expelled from the platform and the workshop at CyVerse's sole discretion without warning.

To report a violation of this Code, directly message a trainer via Slack or email info@cyverse.org with the following information:

Your contact information
Names (real, username, pseudonyms) of any individuals involved, and or witness(es) if any.
Your account of what occurred and if the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly available record (a tweet, public chat log, etc.), please include a link or attachment.
Any additional information that may be helpful in resolving the issue.
